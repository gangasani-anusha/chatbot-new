QUESTION: why was abortion banned?


PASSAGE: stage. Casey, 505 U. S., at 850. And the Court recognized that the  2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child. Id., at 846. So the Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete. It held that the State could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a womans life or health. It held that even before viability, the State could regulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful ways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court held, a State could not impose a substantial obstacle on a womans right to elect the procedure as she (not the government) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances and complexities of her own life. Ibid. Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs. An abortion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever rational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law. And because, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life is rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of restrictions. The Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the majoritys ruling, though, another States law could do so after ten weeks, or five or three or oneor, again, from the moment of fertilization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipation of todays ruling. More will follow. Some States have enacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, including taking medication in ones own home. They have passed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is the victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapists child or a young girl her fathersno matter if doing so will destroy her life. So too, after todays ruling, some States may compel women to carry to term a fetus with severe physical anomaliesfor example, one afflicted with Tay-Sachs disease, sure to die  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting within a few years of birth. States may even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for protecting a woman from risk of death or physical harm. Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child. Enforcement of all these draconian restrictions will also be left largely to the States devices. A State can of course impose criminal penalties on abortion providers, including lengthy prison sentences. But some States will not stop there. Perhaps, in the wake of todays decision, a state law will criminalize the womans conduct too, incarcerating or fining her for daring to seek or obtain an abortion. And as Texas has recently shown, a State can turn neighbor against neighbor, enlisting fellow citizens in the effort to root out anyone who tries to get an abortion, or to assist another in doing so. The majority tries to hide the geographically expansive effects of its holding. Todays decision, the majority says, permits each State to address abortion as it pleases. Ante, at 79. That is cold comfort, of course, for the poor woman who cannot get the money to fly to a distant State for a procedure. Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from todays decision. In any event, interstate restrictions will also soon be in the offing. After this decision, some States may block women from traveling out of State to obtain abortions, or even from receiving abortion medications from out of State. Some may criminalize efforts, including the provision of information or funding, to help women gain access
