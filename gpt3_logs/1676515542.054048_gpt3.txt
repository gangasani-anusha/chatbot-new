QUESTION: why was abortion banned?


PASSAGE:  25. 25Even before Bractons time, English law imposed punishment for the killing of a fetus. See Leges Henrici Primi 222223 (L. Downer ed. 1972) (imposing penalty for any abortion and treating a woman who aborted a quick child as if she were a murderess).  18 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court of Abortion History 126, and n. 16, 134142, 188194, and nn. 8486 (2006) (Dellapenna); J. Keown, Abortion, Doctors and the Law 312 (1988) (Keown). In 1732, for example, Eleanor Beare was convicted of destroying the Foetus in the Womb of another woman and thereby causing her to miscarry.26 For that crime and another misdemeanor, Beare was sentenced to two days in the pillory and three years imprisonment.27 Although a pre-quickening abortion was not itself considered homicide, it does not follow that abortion was permissible at common lawmuch less that abortion was a legal right. Cf. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 713 (removal of common laws harsh sanctions did not represent an acceptance of suicide). Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case mentioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with no mention of quickening) that he had never met with a case so barbarous and unnatural.28 Similarly, an indictment from 1602, which did not distinguish between a prequickening and post-quickening abortion, described abortion as pernicious and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity. Keown 7 (discussing R. v. Webb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey Indictments 512 (1980)). That the common law did not condone even prequickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call a proto-felony-murder rule. Hale and Blackstone explained a way in which a pre-quickening abortion could rise to the level of a homicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman with child a potion to cause an abortion, and the woman died, it was murder because the potion was given unlawfully to destroy her child within her. 1 Hale 429 430 (emphasis added). As Blackstone explained, to be  26 2 Gentlemans Magazine 931 (Aug. 1732). 27 Id., at 932. 28 Ibid. Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 19 Opinion of the Court murder a killing had to be done with malice aforethought, . . . either express or implied. 4 Blackstone 198 (emphasis deleted). In the case of an abortionist, Blackstone wrote, the law will imply [malice] for the same reason that it would imply malice if a person who intended to kill one person accidentally killed a different person: [I]f one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is murder; because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other. The same is the case, where one lays poison for A; and B, against whom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, and it kills him; this is likewise murder. So also, if one gives a woman with child a medicine to procure abortion, and it operates so violently as to kill the woman, this is murder in the person who gave it. Id., at 200 201 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).29 Notably, Blackstone, like Hale, did not state that this proto-felony-murder rule required that the woman be with quick childonly that she be with child. Id., at 201. And it is revealing that Hale and Blackstone treated abortionists differently from other physicians or surgeons who caused the death of a patient without any intent of doing [the patient] any bodily hurt. Hale 429; see 4 Blackstone 197. These other physicianseven if unlicensedwould not be guilty of murder or manslaughter. Hale 429. But a physician performing an abortion would, precisely because his aim was an unlawful one. In sum, although common-law authorities differed on the severity of punishment for abortions committed at different  29Other treatises restated the same rule. See 1 W. Russell & C. Greaves, Crimes and Misdemeanors 540 (5th ed. 1845) (So where a person gave medicine to a woman to procure an abortion,
