QUESTION: why was abortion banned?


PASSAGE: was undeniably the first person to fully    16 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court Not only was there no support for such a constitutional right until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roes faulty historical analysis. It is therefore important to set the record straight. 2 a We begin with the common law, under which abortion was a crime at least after quickeningi.e., the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy.24  articulate on paper the argument that a womans right to choose abortion was a fundamental individual freedom protected by the U. S. Constitutions guarantee of personal liberty). 24The exact meaning of quickening is subject to some debate. Compare Brief for Scholars of Jurisprudence as Amici Curiae 1214, and n. 32 (emphasis deleted) ( a quick child  meant simply a live child, and under the eras outdated knowledge of embryology, a fetus was thought to become quick at around the sixth week of pregnancy), with Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 2 (quick and quickening consistently meant the womans perception of fetal movement). We need not wade into this debate. First, it suffices for present purposes to show that abortion was criminal by at least the 16th or 18th week of pregnancy. Second, as we will show, during the relevant periodi.e., the period surrounding the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendmentthe quickening distinction was abandoned as States criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy. See infra, at 21  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 17 Opinion of the Court The eminent common-law authorities (Blackstone, Coke, Hale, and the like), Kahler v. Kansas, 589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 7), all describe abortion after quickening as criminal. Henry de Bractons 13th-century treatise explained that if a person has struck a pregnant woman, or has given her poison, whereby he has caused abortion, if the foetus be already formed and animated, and particularly if it be animated, he commits homicide. 2 De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 279 (T. Twiss ed. 1879); see also 1 Fleta, c. 23, reprinted in 72 Selden Soc. 60 61 (H. Richardson & G. Sayles eds. 1955) (13th-century treatise).25 Sir Edward Cokes 17th-century treatise likewise asserted that abortion of a quick child was murder if the childe be born alive and a great misprision if the childe dieth in her body. 3 Institutes of the Laws of England 50 51 (1644). (Misprision referred to some heynous offence under the degree of felony. Id., at 139.) Two treatises by Sir Matthew Hale likewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb as a great crime and a great misprision. Pleas of the Crown 53 (P. Glazebrook ed. 1972); 1 History of the Pleas of the Crown 433 (1736) (Hale). And writing near the time of the adoption of our Constitution, William Blackstone explained that abortion of a quick child was by the ancient law homicide or manslaughter (citing Bracton), and at least a very heinous misdemeanor (citing Coke). 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 129130 (7th ed. 1775) (Blackstone). English cases dating all the way back to the 13th century corroborate the treatises statements that abortion was a crime. See generally J. Dellapenna, Dispelling the Myths

RESPONSE:

The passage explains that abortion was banned because it was a crime under common law. Abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow.
