QUESTION: what are the payment methods?


PASSAGE: decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. 2 In drawing this critical distinction between the abortion right and other rights, it is not necessary to dispute Caseys claim (which we accept for the sake of argument) that the Cite as: 597 U.

S., at 848. Abortion is nothing new. It has been addressed by lawmakers for centuries, and the fundamental moral question that it poses is ageless.  Defenders of Roe and Casey do not claim that any new scientific learning calls for a different answer to the underlying moral question, but they do contend that changes in society require the recognition of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Without the availability of abortion, they maintain, people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to choose the types of relationships they desire, and women will be unable to compete with men in the workplace and in other endeavors. Americans who believe that abortion should be restricted press countervailing arguments about modern developments.

See 124 Stat. 163, 42 U. S. C. 18022(b)(1)(D). The ACA also prohibits annual limits, see 300gg11, and limits annual cost-sharing obligations on such benefits, 18022(c). State Medicaid plans must provide coverage for pregnancy-related servicesincluding, but not limited to, prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum careas well as services for other conditions that might complicate the pregnancy. 42 CFR 440.210(a)(2)(i)(ii) (2020).
