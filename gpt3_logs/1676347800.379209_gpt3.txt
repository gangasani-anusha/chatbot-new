RESPONSE:

On February 23, 2021, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a ruling that elective abortions after twenty weeks are permitted in Canada, China, Iceland, Guinea-Bissau, the Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam. The Court rejected the arbitrary viability rule that had been in place previously. This ruling means that women in these countries will now have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, without having to meet any specific criteria.
