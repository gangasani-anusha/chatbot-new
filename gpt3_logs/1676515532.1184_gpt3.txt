QUESTION: why was abortion banned?


PASSAGE: guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what that Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. That is why the Court has long been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992). Substantive due process has at times been a treacherous field for this Court, Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion), and it has sometimes led the Court to usurp authority that the Constitution entrusts to the peoples elected representatives. See Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 225 226 (1985). As the Court cautioned in Glucksberg, [w]e must . . . exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the Members of this Court. 521 U. S., at 720 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). On occasion, when the Court has ignored the [a]ppropriate limits imposed by respect for the teachings of history, Moore, 431 U. S., at 503 (plurality opinion), it has fallen into the freewheeling judicial policymaking that characterized discredited decisions such as Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). The Court must not fall prey to such an unprincipled approach. Instead, guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nations concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term liberty. When we engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect  21Four Essays on Liberty 121 (1969).   Cite as: 597 U.

And although law review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights, the earliest article proposing a constitutional right to abortion that has come to our attention was published only a few years before Roe.23  22That is true regardless of whether we look to the Amendments Due Process Clause or its Privileges or Immunities Clause. Some scholars and Justices have maintained that the Privileges or Immunities Clause is the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that guarantees substantive rights. See, e.g., McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 813850 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Duncan, 391 U. S., at 165166 (Black, J., concurring); A.

See Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546, 551552 (No. 3,230) (CC ED Pa. 1823) (describing unenumerated rights under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art.

(reserving the question whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects any rights besides those enumerated in the Constitution). 23See R.

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The passage explains that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion. The reason for this is that, until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. This means that no state constitutional provision had recognized such a right, and no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Furthermore, no scholarly treatise of which the author is aware had proposed a constitutional right to abortion. The earliest article proposing such a right was published only a few years before the Roe v. Wade decision.
