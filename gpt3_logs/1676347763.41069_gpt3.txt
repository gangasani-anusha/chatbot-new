Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question:


QUESTION: why was abortion banned?


PASSAGE: eroded the underpinnings of the viability line, such as they were. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995). The viability line is a relic of a time when we recognized only two state interests warranting regulation of abortion: maternal health and protection of potential life. Roe, 410 U. S., at 162163. That changed with Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124 (2007). There, we recognized a broader array of interests, such as drawing a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide, maintaining societal ethics, and preserving the integrity of the medical profession. Id., at 157160. The viability line has nothing to do with advancing such permissible goals. Cf. id., at 171 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (Gonzales blur[red] the line, firmly drawn in Casey, between previability and postviability abortions); see also R. Beck, Gonzales, Casey, and the Viability Rule, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 249, 276279 (2009). Consider, for example, statutes passed in a number of jurisdictions that forbid abortions after twenty weeks of pregnancy, premised on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of development. See, e.g., Ala. Code 2623B2 (2018). Assuming that prevention of fetal pain is a legitimate state interest after Gonzales, there seems to be no reason why viability would be relevant to the permissibility of such laws. The same is true of laws designed to protect[] the integrity and ethics of the medical profession and restrict procedures likely to coarsen society to the dignity of human life. Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 157. Mississippis law, for instance, was premised in part on the legislatures finding that the dilation and evacuation procedure is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and    Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 5 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment demeaning to the medical profession. Miss. Code Ann. 4141191(2)(b)(i)(8). That procedure accounts for most abortions performed after the first trimestertwo weeks before the period at issue in this caseand involve[s] the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child apart. Ibid.; see also Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 135. Again, it would make little sense to focus on viability when evaluating a law based on these permissible goals. In short, the viability rule was created outside the ordinary course of litigation, is and always has been completely unreasoned, and fails to take account of state interests since recognized as legitimate. It is indeed telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew a viability line. Ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court). Only a handful of countries, among them China and North Korea, permit elective abortions after twenty weeks; the rest have coalesced around a 12week line. See The Worlds Abortion Laws, Center for Reproductive Rights (Feb. 23, 2021) (online source archived at www.supremecourt.gov) (Canada, China, Iceland, Guinea-Bissau, the Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam permit elective abortions after twenty weeks). The Court rightly rejects the arbitrary viability rule today. II None of this, however, requires that we also take the dramatic step of altogether eliminating the abortion right first recognized in Roe. Mississippi itself previously argued as much to this Court in this litigation. When the State petitioned for our review, its basic request was straightforward: clarify whether abortion prohibitions before viability are always unconstitutional. Pet. for Cert. 14. The State made a number of strong arguments that the answer is no, id., at 1526arguments that, as discussed, I find persuasive. And it went out of its way to make clear that it was not asking the Court to repudiate   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment entirely the right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy: To be clear, the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court to overturn Roe or Casey.

RESPONSE:

The passage explains that the viability line is a relic of a time when we recognized only two state interests warranting regulation of abortion: maternal health and protection of potential life. Roe, 410 U. S., at 162163. That changed with Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124 (2007). There, we recognized a broader array of interests, such as drawing a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide, maintaining societal ethics, and preserving the integrity of the medical profession. Id., at 157160. The viability rule was created outside the ordinary course of litigation, is and always has been completely unreasoned, and fails to take account of state interests since recognized as legitimate. It is indeed telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew a viability line. Ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court). Only a handful of countries, among them China and North Korea, permit elective abortions after twenty weeks; the rest have coalesced around a 12week line.
