which has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists. Finally, the Casey plurality's undue burden test has scored poorly on the workability scale.  The passage explains that abortion was banned because the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child. The Court held that the State could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a womans life or health.  The Court struck down laws requiring that second-trimester abortions be performed only in hospitals, Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.

This belief led to the passage of laws in several states that made it a crime to perform an abortion. Another reason why abortion was banned was due to the belief that it was unsafe. This belief was based on the fact that abortion procedures were often performed by untrained individuals using unsafe methods. This led to a number of women dying or suffering from complications as a result of their abortions. Finally, another reason why abortion was banned was due to the belief that it was immoral. This belief was based on the idea that abortion goes against the natural order of things, and is therefore morally wrong.  Abortion was banned because it was considered to be a form of manslaughter. Additionally, anyone who administered or prescribed any medicine or drugs to any woman with child, with the intent to produce an abortion, was subject to a fine and imprisonment.  The main reason why abortion was banned was because of the tradition of prohibiting it on pain of criminal punishment. This tradition dates back to the earliest days of the common law, and was still in place in 1973 when Roe v. Wade was decided. The Supreme Court in Roe could have cited the same historical evidence that Glucksberg did in support of a ban on assisted suicide. However, respondents and their amici have no persuasive answer to this historical evidence. Instead, they are forced to argue that it does not matter that some States prohibited abortion at the time Roe was decided or when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. But this argument flies in the face of the standard that the Supreme Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. There is no support for the existence of an abortion right that predates the latter part of the 20th century. The earliest sources cited by respondents and their amici are a few district court and state court decisions decided shortly before Roe and a small number of law review articles from the same time period. These sources are not persuasive, and Roe's reliance on them is unsupportable.  The most likely reason why abortion was banned is that the Supreme Court found that there are a number of legitimate state interests that justify such a ban. In particular, the Court found that abortions after twenty weeks of pregnancy are barbaric and demeaning to the medical profession, and that they pose a danger to the maternal patient.
