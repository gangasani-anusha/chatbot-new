QUESTION: why was abortion banned?


PASSAGE: S. 438 (same, for unmarried persons). But none of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed potential life. When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were consistent with the following: (1) the relative weights of the respective interests involved, (2) the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, (3) the lenity of the common law, and (4) the demands of the profound problems of the present day. Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. Put aside the second and third factors, which were based on the Courts flawed account of history, and what remains are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. c What Roe did not provide was any cogent justification for the lines it drew. Why, for example, does a State have no    50 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court authority to regulate first trimester abortions for the purpose of protecting a womans health? The Courts only explanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage were lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. Id., at 163. But the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the only factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences short of death. And the Court did not explain why it departed from the normal rule that courts defer to the judgments of legislatures in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties. Marshall v. United States, 414 U. S. 417, 427 (1974). An even more glaring deficiency was Roes failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and postviability abortions. Here is the Courts entire explanation: With respect to the States important and legitimate interest in potential life, the compelling point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the womb. 410 U. S., at 163. As Professor Laurence Tribe has written, [c]learly, this mistakes a definition for a syllogism. Tribe 4 (quoting Ely 924). The definition of a viable fetus is one that is capable of surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at which the States interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe held, a States interest in protecting prenatal life is compelling after viability, 410 U. S., at 163, why isnt that interest equally compelling before viability? Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 519 (1989) (plurality opinion) (quoting Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 795 (White, J., dissenting)). Roe did not say, and no explanation is apparent. This arbitrary line has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. Some have argued that a fetus should not Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 51 Opinion of the Court be entitled to legal protection until it acquires the characteristics that they regard as defining what it means to be a person. Among the characteristics that have been offered as essential attributes of personhood are sentience, selfawareness, the ability to reason, or some combination thereof.50 By this logic, it would be an open question whether even born individuals, including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions, merit protection as persons. But even if one takes the view that personhood begins when a certain attribute or combination of attributes is acquired, it is very hard to see why viability should mark the point where personhood begins. The most obvious problem with any such argument is that viability is heavily dependent on factors that have nothing to do with the


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

There are a few possible reasons why abortion may have been banned. One reason is that Roe v. Wade, the case that legalized abortion, did not provide a cogent justification for the lines it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. The Court's only explanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage were lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. However, the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the only factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences short of death. Another possible reason is that some philosophers and ethicists argue that a fetus should not be entitled to legal protection until it acquires certain characteristics, such as sentience, self-awareness, or the ability to reason. By this logic, it would be an open question whether even born individuals, including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions, merit protection as persons.
