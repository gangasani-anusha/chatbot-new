DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The quickening rule was the original basis for the ban on abortion, which held that a fetus was not considered a separate and independent entity before it had quickened (moved). This rule was eventually abandoned in the 19th century, as medical professionals and commentators criticized it as being neither in accordance with medical experience nor with the principles of the common law. In 1803, the British Parliament made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy, and by 1868, three-quarters of the States had followed suit. The main reason for the ban on abortion appears to be the protection of fetal life.
