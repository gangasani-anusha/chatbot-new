QUESTION: why was abortion banned?


PASSAGE: legislators who voted for a law, we  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 29 Opinion of the Court have been reluctant to attribute those motives to the legislative body as a whole. What motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it. Id., at 384. Here, the argument about legislative motive is not even based on statements by legislators, but on statements made by a few supporters of the new 19th-century abortion laws, and it is quite a leap to attribute these motives to all the legislators whose votes were responsible for the enactment of those laws. Recall that at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, over three-quarters of the States had adopted statutes criminalizing abortion (usually at all stages of pregnancy), and that from the early 20th century until the day Roe was handed down, every single State had such a law on its books. Are we to believe that the hundreds of lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact these laws were motivated by hostility to Catholics and women? There is ample evidence that the passage of these laws was instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries made that point. See, e.g., Nash v. Meyer, 54 Idaho 283, 301, 31 P. 2d 273, 280 (1934); State v. Ausplund, 86 Ore. 121, 131132, 167 P. 1019, 10221023 (1917); Trent v. State, 15 Ala. App. 485, 488, 73 S. 834, 836 (1916); State v. Miller, 90 Kan. 230, 233, 133 P. 878, 879 (1913); State v. Tippie, 89 Ohio St. 35, 3940, 105 N. E. 75, 77 (1913); State v. Gedicke, 43 N. J. L. 86, 90 (1881); Dougherty v. People, 1 Colo. 514, 522523 (1873); State v. Moore, 25 Iowa 128, 131132 (1868); Smith, 33 Me., at 57; see also Memphis Center for Reproductive Health v. Slatery, 14 F. 4th 409, 446, and n. 11 (CA6 2021) (Thapar, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (citing cases). One may disagree with this belief (and our decision is not based on any view about when a State should regard prenatal life as having rights or legally cognizable interests),  30 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court but even Roe and Casey did not question the good faith of abortion opponents. See, e.g., Casey, 505 U. S., at 850 (Men and women of good conscience can disagree . . . about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy even in its earliest stage). And we see no reason to discount the significance of the state laws in question based on these amicis suggestions about legislative motive.41 C 1 Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described it as the freedom to make intimate and personal choices that are central to personal dignity and autonomy, 505 U. S., at 851. Casey elaborated: At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Ibid. The Court did not claim that this broadly framed right is absolute, and no such claim would be plausible. While individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they  41Other amicus briefs present arguments about the motives of proponents of liberal access to abortion. They note that some such supporters have been motivated by a desire to suppress the size of the AfricanAmerican population.

S. ___, ______ (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 14). And it is beyond dispute that Roe has had that demographic effect. A highly disproportionate percentage of aborted fetuses are Black.

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

There are a few different reasons why abortion may have been banned. One reason is that legislators at the time may have sincerely believed that abortion kills a human being. This was based on judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries which stated this belief. Another possibility is that the passage of these laws was spurred by a desire to suppress the size of the African American population. This is supported by the fact that a disproportionate number of aborted fetuses are Black.
