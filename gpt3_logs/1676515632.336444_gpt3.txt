Write a detailed summary of the following:

The most common reason given for why abortion was banned is that it was thought to be unsafe. This is based on the belief that abortion is a medical procedure that carries with it a number of risks, including the risk of infection, hemorrhage, and even death. In addition, there was also the belief that abortion could lead to psychological damage to the woman involved.  There are a few different reasons why abortion may have been banned. One reason is that many states in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions, so it was thought that the states had the authority to do so. Another reason is that common-law authorities repeatedly condemned abortion and described it as an unlawful act, regardless of whether it occurred before or after quickening. Additionally, some argue that important motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than Protestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White Protestant women to shirk their maternal duties.  The passage explains that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion. The reason for this is that, until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. This means that no state constitutional provision had recognized such a right, and no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Furthermore, no scholarly treatise of which the author is aware had proposed a constitutional right to abortion. The earliest article proposing such a right was published only a few years before the Roe v. Wade decision.  The passage provides a list of state laws banning abortion, dating from 1856 to 1860. The laws all make it a crime to administer drugs or use instruments with the intent of causing a miscarriage, unless the life of the mother is in danger. It is not clear from the passage why these laws were enacted, but it is possible that they were motivated by a desire to protect women's health, to prevent abortions from being used as a means of birth control, or to protect the sanctity of human life.  The main reason why abortion was banned was because it was considered to be a crime against fetal life. This was based on the common law rule that a fetus was not considered to be a separate and independent entity until it had reached the stage of quickening (when the mother first felt it move). This rule was criticized by medical experts and commentators as being impractical and out of step with the way that other areas of law treated prenatal life. In 1803, the British Parliament made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy, and this law was adopted by many states in the US during the 19th century.  Abortion was banned because it was considered a barbarous and unnatural act that was punishable by law.  Abortion was banned in the late 1800s in order to protect the lives of both mothers and their unborn children. This was done by criminalizing the act of performing or attempting to perform an abortion, as well as the act of prescribing or providing any sort of advice, direction, or knowledge related to abortion. The punishment for these acts varied from state to state, but typically included a prison sentence and/or a fine.  The main reason why abortion was banned was because it was felt that it destroyed potential life, and that it was a unique act that could not be compared to other rights that had been recognized by the court.  The primary reason why abortion was banned was because legislators believed that it killed a human being. This belief was based on the statements of a few supporters of the new 19th-century abortion laws. However, some people believe that the real motivation behind the ban was to suppress the size of the African-American population.  Abortion was banned because it was not deeply rooted in the Nations history and tradition. The Court finds that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nations history and tradition. The underlying theory on which Casey restedthat the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for libertyhas long been controversial. The Courts decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rightsthose rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition and whether it is essential to this Nations scheme of ordered liberty. Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted). The term liberty alone provides little guidance. Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to recognize a new component of the liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by liberty, the Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Courts own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. For this reason, Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3 Syllabus the Court has been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125. Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of the Nations concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the Fourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abortion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roes faulty historical analysis. Respondents argument that this history does not matter flies in the face of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor General repeats Roes claim that it is doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus, 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law authoritiesBracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstoneall wrote that a postquickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, many authorities asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was unlawful and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right because of the common laws failure to criminalize abortion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle, 83 N. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought  The passage explains that abortion was banned because it was a crime under common law. Abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow.  There are a few reasons why abortion may have been banned. One reason is that it may have been seen as too risky for the mother's health. Another reason is that it may have been seen as too emotionally difficult for the mother to deal with. Finally, it may have been seen as too disruptive to the family unit.  There are a few possible reasons why abortion may have been banned. One reason is that Roe v. Wade, the case that legalized abortion, did not provide a cogent justification for the lines it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. The Court's only explanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage were lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. However, the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the only factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences short of death. Another possible reason is that some philosophers and ethicists argue that a fetus should not be entitled to legal protection until it acquires certain characteristics, such as sentience, self-awareness, or the ability to reason. By this logic, it would be an open question whether even born individuals, including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions, merit protection as persons.  The primary reason why abortion was banned was because the Roe v. Wade decision imposed a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters, without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent. Additionally, the Court failed to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions,
