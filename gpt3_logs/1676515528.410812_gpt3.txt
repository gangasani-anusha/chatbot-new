QUESTION: why was abortion banned?


PASSAGE: laws failure to criminalize abortion before quickening means that at the Founding and for decades thereafter, women generally could terminate a pregnancy, at least in its early stages.40 Brief for United States 2627; see also Brief for Respondents 21. But the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills, 13 Pa., at 633; State v. Slagle, 83 N. C. 630, 632 (1880), and regardless, the fact that many States in the  38For critiques of Meanss work, see, e.g., Dellapenna 143152, 325 331; Keown 312; J. Finnis, Shameless Acts in Colorado: Abuse of Scholarship in Constitutional Cases, 7 Academic Questions 10, 1112 (1994); R. Destro, Abortion and the Constitution: The Need for a LifeProtective Amendment, 63 Cal. L. Rev. 1250, 12671282 (1975); R. Byrn, An American Tragedy: The Supreme Court on Abortion, 41 Ford. L. Rev. 807, 814829 (1973). 39Garrow 500501, and n. 41 (internal quotation marks omitted). 40 In any event, Roe, Casey, and other related abortion decisions imposed substantial restrictions on a States capacity to regulate abortions performed after quickening. See, e.g., June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___ (2020) (holding a law requiring doctors performing abortions to secure admitting privileges to be unconstitutional); Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582 (2016) (similar); Casey, 505 U. S., at 846 (declaring that prohibitions on abortion before viability are unconstitutional); id., at 887898 (holding that a spousal notification provision was unconstitutional). In addition, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973), has been interpreted by some to protect a broad right to obtain an abortion at any stage of pregnancy provided that a physician is willing to certify that it is needed due to a womans emotional needs or familial concerns. Id., at 192. See, e.g., Womens Medical Professional Corp. v. Voinovich, 130 F. 3d 187, 209 (CA6 1997), cert. denied, 523 U. S. 1036 (1998); but see id., at 1039 (THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  28 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize prequickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the authority to do so. When legislatures began to exercise that authority as the century wore on, no one, as far as we are aware, argued that the laws they enacted violated a fundamental right. That is not surprising since common-law authorities had repeatedly condemned abortion and described it as an unlawful act without regard to whether it occurred before or after quickening. See supra, at 1621. Another amicus brief relied upon by respondents (see Brief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significance of the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that they were enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to this account, which is based almost entirely on statements made by one prominent proponent of the statutes, important motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than Protestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White Protestant women to shir[k their] maternal duties. Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 20. Resort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any real historical support for the right that Roe and Casey recognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based on alleged legislative motives. See, e.g., Erie v. Paps A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 292 (2000) (plurality opinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 652 (1994); United States v. OBrien, 391 U. S. 367, 383 (1968); Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423, 455 (1931) (collecting cases). The Court has recognized that inquiries into legislative motives are a hazardous matter. OBrien, 391 U. S., at 383. Even when an argument about legislative motive is backed by statements made by


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

There are a few different reasons why abortion may have been banned. One reason is that many states in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions, so it was thought that the states had the authority to do so. Another reason is that common-law authorities repeatedly condemned abortion and described it as an unlawful act, regardless of whether it occurred before or after quickening. Additionally, some argue that important motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than Protestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White Protestant women to shirk their maternal duties.
