RESPONSE:

The answer to this question is complex, as there is no one simple reason why abortion was banned. There are a variety of factors that contributed to the ban on abortion, including religious beliefs, cultural norms, and legal precedent. One of the primary reasons why abortion was banned was due to religious beliefs. Many religions, including Christianity, view abortion as a sin. This belief led to pressure from religious groups to ban abortion. Cultural norms also played a role in the ban on abortion. In many cultures, it was considered taboo to terminate a pregnancy. This belief led to social pressure to ban abortion. Legal precedent also contributed to the ban on abortion. In 1868, a number of states had laws criminalizing abortion. These laws served as a precedent for the eventual nationwide ban on abortion.
